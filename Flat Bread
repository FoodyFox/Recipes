Notes:

  - Quick, simple flatbread that makes 2 large 12" breads

  - Try adding some herbs such as rosemary or fennel seeds to flavour

  - Need to try cooking a few of these and freezing

Ingredients:

  300g Strong Bread Flour
  225g Natural Yoghurt
  2 tsp Baking Powder
  12g Sugar
  6g Salt
  1 Tablespoon Olive Oil

Method:

  - Add all ingredients in a bowl and mix with a fork until it has nearly come together

  - Mix with your hand and lightly knead until the dough looks fairly consistant

  - Split in two and leave to rest for 5-10 mins

  - Add a small amount of semolina and roll out as thin as possible

  - Cook on a pizza stone in a 370C oven for 1 minute, turn over and cook for another 40 to 60 seconds

  - Keep covered in a lightly dampened tea towel so that they remain soft until use

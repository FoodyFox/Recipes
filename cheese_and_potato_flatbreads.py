def cheese_and_potato_flatbreads()

'''

Notes:

  - Great alternative to something like a quiche for a lunch with a side salad.

  - Filling can be anything really, but the potato and cheese work well as a binder for everything else. Just make sure everything is cooked and cooled for the filling.

  - Try switching the feta for minced beef and using suet in the dough. Or pork mince and lard for a pork pie twist.

Ingredients:

  Dough:
    150g Flour (either Plain or Bread)
    75g Milk
    25g Butter/Lard/Suet
    3g Salt

  Filling:
    1 Large Potato (approx 250g) cooked, peeled and cooled
    1 block (200g) Feta Cheese Crumbled
    150g Cheese (Mozzeralla, Cheddar etc) grated or cubed
    2 spring onions chopped
    Seasoning to taste

Method:

  - Combine the dough ingredients in a bowl with a fork until it roughly comes together. Kneed for 3-5 minutes until smooth

  - Mix all the filling ingredients and season well. Form in to a thick disc approx 15cm diameter

  - Roll out the dough to a disc approx 25cm

  - Place the filling in the centre and pull the dough edges over towards the centre to encapsulate the filling, sealing as you go

  - Once fully sealed, gently roll out to the size of your skillet

  - Cook on a low heat in a tablespoon of butter on each side for 5 mins and if necessary finish in a 200C oven for 5 mins
